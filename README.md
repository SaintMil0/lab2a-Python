a. `print("All the world's a stage,")
    print("And all the men and women merely players:")
    print("They have their exits and their entrances;")
    print("And one man in his time plays many parts,")
    print("His acts being seven ages.")

b.

    paragraph = "All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages."
    print(paragraph)
  `  

c. Output of print("127","0","0","1", sep=".") is 127.0.0.1
   localhost server normally

d.   flush=True: When you need output immediately, for example showing a progress bar/loading message during a long loop so the user sees updates in real time.
    flush=False: Normal prints where immediate display is not critical, for example simple scripts that just print results at the end.

e.  The end argument (default end="\n") causes output to be flushed when a newline is printed, because standard output is line-buffered.


For challenges I did not have a very difficult time with this lab it was straight foward, but Realizing that one print() with \n still produces the same visible output as many print() calls.
